  <h2>3) Accounts, Authentication, and Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app uses Google OAuth 2.0 for authentication.

  <h2>5) Intellectual Property</h2>

You may not copy, modify, or distribute the app except as permitted by law.</p>

  <h2>6) Service Changes and Availability</h2>
  <p>Features may change or be discontinued, including due to updates in YouTube API Services, quota limits, or policy compliance requirements.</p>

  <h2>7) Termination</h2>
