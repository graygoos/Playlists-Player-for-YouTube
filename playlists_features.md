# YouTube Playlist App Features

This list outlines features you can implement using the YouTube Data API v3, categorized into free and premium tiers.

## Free Features (Core Functionality)
These features provide the essential experience of viewing and playing YouTube playlists.

- **User Playlist Listing**: Display a list of all YouTube playlists associated with the signed-in user's account. (Uses playlists.list endpoint)
- **Playlist Video Playback**: Allow users to select a playlist and play its videos sequentially within the app. (Uses playlistItems.list to get video IDs, then videos.list for video details and embedding the YouTube player)
- **Basic Playback Controls**: Standard controls like play, pause, skip to next/previous video within a playlist.
- **Video Information Display**: Show essential video details such as title, description, channel name, and thumbnail. (Uses videos.list endpoint)
- **Basic Search within Playlists**: Enable users to search for specific videos by title within a currently viewed playlist (client-side filtering).
- **Playlist Favoriting/Bookmarking**: Allow users to mark specific playlists as favorites for quick access within the app (requires local storage in your app).
- **View Channel Information**: Display basic information about the channel that created a video or playlist. (Uses channels.list endpoint)

## Premium Features (Enhanced Experience & Advanced Functionality)
These features offer added convenience, customization, or advanced management capabilities, making them suitable for a paywall.

- **Advanced Playback Controls**:
  - Shuffle Playback: Randomize the order of videos within any playlist.
  - Loop Playback: Option to loop the current video or the entire playlist indefinitely.
  - Playback Speed Control: Adjust video playback speed (e.g., 0.5x, 1.5x, 2x).
  - Mini-Player/Picture-in-Picture (PiP): Allow video playback to continue in a floating window while the user navigates other parts of your app or other apps (leverages iOS native PiP, but can be a premium feature for your app).
- **Enhanced Playlist Management**:
  - Create New Playlists: Allow users to create new public, private, or unlisted YouTube playlists directly from your app. (Uses playlists.insert endpoint)
  - Add/Remove Videos: Enable users to add new videos to existing playlists or remove videos from them. (Uses playlistItems.insert and playlistItems.delete endpoints)
  - Reorder Videos: Provide drag-and-drop functionality to change the order of videos within a playlist. (Uses playlistItems.update endpoint)
  - Edit Playlist Metadata: Change a playlist's title, description, or privacy status. (Uses playlists.update endpoint)
- **Detailed Analytics & Statistics**:
  - View Video Statistics: Display detailed metrics for videos, such as like/dislike counts, view counts, and comment counts. (Uses videos.list with statistics part)
  - App-Specific Playback History: Track and display the user's watch history within your app, potentially with insights like total watch time for a playlist.
- **Discovery & Curation Tools**:
  - Advanced Filtering & Sorting: Offer sophisticated options to filter playlists or videos (e.g., by duration, upload date, number of videos, channel).
  - Smart Recommendations: Suggest new videos or playlists based on the user's viewing habits within your app (requires implementing your own recommendation logic, potentially using search.list for related content).
- **App Customization**:
  - Custom Themes: Allow users to change the app's color scheme or visual theme.
  - Alternative App Icons: Offer a selection of custom app icons.
- **Comment Interaction**:
  - View Comments: Allow users to read comments on videos within the app. (Uses commentThreads.list endpoint)
  - Post Comments: Enable users to post new comments on videos directly from your app. (Uses comments.insert endpoint)

## Important Considerations

- **YouTube API Terms of Service**: Always ensure your app adheres to YouTube's API Services Terms of Service, especially regarding content usage and monetization. For instance, directly downloading YouTube videos for offline playback is generally prohibited by their terms.
- **Authentication Scopes**: Features requiring user-specific data or actions (like managing playlists, creating comments) will require the user to grant your app specific OAuth 2.0 scopes (e.g., https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl or https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube). Read-only access to public data is generally easier to implement without extensive user permissions.
- **Monetization Strategy**: Clearly define what constitutes "premium" value for your users. Convenience, advanced control, and deeper insights are often good candidates for premium features.
- **YouTube Premium**: Note that "ad-free playback" is a feature of YouTube Premium itself. Your app cannot remove ads from YouTube videos unless the user is already a YouTube Premium subscriber. You could potentially highlight this integration (e.g., "Enjoy ad-free playback with your YouTube Premium subscription").
