    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: August 9, 2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Playlists Player for YouTube</strong> ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we access, use, store, and share your information — including Google user data — when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you sign in with your Google account, we may collect the following Google user data as permitted by the YouTube Data API v3 and the scopes you authorize:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your YouTube playlist metadata (titles, IDs, and video lists).</li>
        <li>Information about your playlists and videos that you choose to view or play in the app.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Additionally, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information about how you interact with the app, such as playlists viewed, videos played, and feature usage. This is stored locally on your device unless explicitly sent to our servers for specific features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Google User Data</h2>
    <p>We use the Google user data we collect solely to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display and play your YouTube playlists within the app.</li>
        <li>Enable optional premium features such as playlist management and analytics.</li>
        <li>Improve and optimize app performance based on usage patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use Google user data for advertising, profiling, AI model training, or any purpose unrelated to providing or improving the application’s functionality.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure of Google User Data</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your Google user data with third parties, except as necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations.</li>
        <li>Provide the app’s core functionality via the YouTube Data API.</li>
        <li>Protect our rights, safety, and the safety of others.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take the protection of your data seriously and use the following measures:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTTPS encryption for all data transmitted between the app and our servers.</li>
        <li>Secure local storage for data saved on your device.</li>
        <li>Restricted access to Google API tokens, stored securely and never exposed publicly.</li>
        <li>Regular security reviews and updates to address vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While we use industry-standard security methods, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We retain Google user data only for as long as necessary to provide and improve the app's functionality, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</p>
    <p>When the retention period ends, or upon your request, we securely delete or anonymize your data.</p>
    <p>You can request deletion of your Google user data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:femialiu713@gmail.com">femialu713@gmail.com</a>. We will verify your request and delete the data within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You can manage or revoke the app’s access to your Google account at any time by visiting your <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank">Google Account Permissions</a> page. You can also uninstall the app to stop any further data collection.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with the updated date. If we make significant changes, we will notify you through the app or via email before the changes take effect.</p>
