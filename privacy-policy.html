  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 18, 2025</p>

  <p>Welcome to <strong>Playlists Player for YouTube</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our application accesses, uses, stores, and shares information — including Google user data — when you use the app.</p>

  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Use of YouTube API Services:</strong> This application uses <em>YouTube API Services</em>. By using this app, you agree to be bound by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/t/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Terms of Service</a>. For information on how Google handles data, please review the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1) Who controls your data</h2>
  <p>We (the app developers) do <strong>not</strong> operate any backend that collects or stores your personal data. All app functionality runs on your device and talks directly to Google’s services via OAuth 2.0. We do not receive or retain your YouTube content or personal data on our servers.</p>

  <h2>2) Information the app accesses</h2>
  <p>Depending on the scopes you authorize during Google sign-in, the app may access limited YouTube data to provide core features:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Playlist metadata:</strong> playlist titles, IDs, and item lists (via YouTube Data API v3).</li>
    <li><strong>Video metadata:</strong> titles, thumbnails, channel information, and public statistics (e.g., view/like counts).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>App-generated data:</strong> The app may create on-device usage records such as playback history (e.g., when you started/stopped a video, completion percentage) solely to power in-app analytics and history views. This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to us.</p>

  <h2>3) How information is used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To display and play your YouTube playlists and videos within the app.</li>
    <li>To enable optional playlist management features you initiate (e.g., create, edit, reorder, or delete your own playlists/videos).</li>
    <li>To improve performance (e.g., quicker loading of lists you’ve recently viewed).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use Google user data for advertising, profiling, reselling, or model training.</p>

  <h2>4) Local storage, caching, and cookies</h2>
  <p>To improve performance and reduce unnecessary network/data usage, the app may <strong>cache limited metadata</strong> (e.g., playlist IDs, video IDs, titles, thumbnails, timestamps) <strong>locally on your device</strong>. The app does <strong>not</strong> use cookies or third‑party tracking technologies. No cross‑site tracking occurs.</p>

  <h2>5) Sharing and disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your Google user data. Data is only shared with Google as necessary to provide the app’s core functionality through YouTube API Services, or as required by law.</p>

  <h2>6) Security</h2>
  <p>All communications with Google APIs occur over HTTPS. OAuth tokens are stored securely on the device and are never exposed publicly. While we apply reasonable safeguards, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>7) Data retention and deletion</h2>
  <p>On-device caches and app-generated history are retained only as long as needed for functionality and may be cleared by you at any time via in-app settings or by uninstalling the app. We do not retain copies on external servers.</p>
  <p>You can revoke the app’s access to your Google account at any time at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>. If you contact us to request assistance with deletion, email <a href="mailto:femialiu713@gmail.com">femialiu713@gmail.com</a> and we will provide instructions; any data stored solely on-device is under your control.</p>

  <h2>8) Your choices and controls</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Manage Google permissions: <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a></li>
    <li>Clear local caches/history via app settings.</li>
    <li>Uninstall the app to stop any further access or caching.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>This app is not directed to children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided Google account access through the app, please revoke access and contact us.</p>

  <h2>10) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be announced in-app, and the “Last Updated” date will be revised.</p>
